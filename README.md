# Test Task

## Requirements:
The task was to create a two-screens application. The first screen is a list of cells where every cell includes a person's image, first name, and second name. The second screen is a result of a tap by cell on the list screen and illustrates the person's details. On the second screen, we should see the person's image, first name, second name, and age. All data must be parsed from JSON file from archive. Person's image for both screens is an URL link and must be downloaded from the web.

## My implementation:

#### Portrait View

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/iosypenk/test/blob/master/ScreenShots/101.png" width="30%" />
  <img src="https://github.com/iosypenk/test/blob/master/ScreenShots/102.png" width="30%" /> 
</div>



#### Landscape orientation
<div align="justify">
 <img src="https://github.com/iosypenk/test/blob/master/ScreenShots/201.png" width="60%" />
 <img src="https://github.com/iosypenk/test/blob/master/ScreenShots/202.png" width="60%" />

</div>
